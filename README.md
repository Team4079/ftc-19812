UGHAFSIAKDHFIPWJEIFEW ***CLAW***

So basically the claw is made of two servo-controlled wheels pointing towards each other.
When they spin towards each other, the sample is intaked; away from each other and the sample is spit out.

I want __two (2)__ states for this claw: Intake & Outtake. Intake should have the servos at position (Top: 1.0, Bottom: -1.0) and the opposite for outtake. Use button A for the claw.
The two servos are topIntake and bottomIntake. 

***PULL REQUEST BY 4:40PM!!!***
